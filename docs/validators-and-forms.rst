[Part 2] - Contact Page: Validators, Forms and Emailing
=======================================================

Overview
--------

Now we have the basic HTML templates in places, its time to make one of the
pages functional. We will begin with one of the simplest pages; The Contact
page. At the end of this chapter you will have a Contact page that allows users
to send the webmaster contact enquiries. These enquiries will be emailed to the
webmaster.

The following areas will be demonstrated in this chapter:

1. Validators
2. Forms
3. Setting bundle configuration values

Contact Page
------------

Routing
~~~~~~~

As with the about page we created in the last chapter, we will start by defining
the contact page route. Open up the ``BloggerBlogBundle`` routing file located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml`` and append the following routing
rule.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml
    BloggerBlogBundle_contact:
        pattern:  /contact
        defaults: { _controller: BloggerBlogBundle:Page:contact }
        requirements:
            _method:  GET

There is nothing new here, the rule matches on the pattern ``/contact``,
for the HTTP ``GET`` method and executes the ``contact`` action of the ``Page`` controller in
the ``BloggerBlogBundle``.

Controller
~~~~~~~~~~

Next lets add the action for the contact page to the ``Page`` Controller in the
``BloggerBlogBundle`` located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php``.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php
    // ..
    public function contactAction()
    {
        return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Page:contact.html.twig');
    }
    // ..

For now the action is very simple, it just renders the contact page view. We will
come back to the controller later.

View
~~~~

Create the contact page view at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/contact.html.twig``
and add the following content.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/contact.html.twig #}
    {% extends 'BloggerBlogBundle::layout.html.twig' %}

    {% block title %}Contact{% endblock%}

    {% block body %}
        <header>
            <h1>Contact symblog</h1>
        </header>

        <p>Want to contact symblog?</p>
    {% endblock %}

This template is also quite simple. It extends the ``BloggerBlogBundle`` layout
template, overrides the title block to set a custom title and defines some
content for the body block.

Linking to the page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lastly we need to update the link in the application template located
at ``app/Resources/views/base.html.twig`` to link to the contact page.

.. code-block:: html

    <!-- app/Resources/views/base.html.twig -->
    {% block navigation %}
        <nav>
            <ul class="navigation">
                <li><a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_homepage') }}">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_about') }}">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_contact') }}">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    {% endblock %}

If you point your browser to ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/`` and click the
contact link in the navigation bar, you should see a very basic contact page
displayed. Now we have the page correctly setup, its time to start working on
the Contact form. This is split into 2 distinct parts; The Validators and The
Form. Before we can address the concept of Validators and the Form we need to
think about how we will handle the data of the contact enquiry.

Contact Entity
--------------

Lets begin by creating a class that represents a contact enquiry from a user. We
want to trap some basic information such as name, subject and enquiry body. Create
a new file located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Enquiry.php`` and paste in the
following content.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Enquiry.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity;

    class Enquiry
    {
        protected $name;

        protected $email;

        protected $subject;

        protected $body;

        public function getName()
        {
            return $this->name;
        }

        public function setName($name)
        {
            $this->name = $name;
        }

        public function getEmail()
        {
            return $this->email;
        }

        public function setEmail($email)
        {
            $this->email = $email;
        }

        public function getSubject()
        {
            return $this->subject;
        }

        public function setSubject($subject)
        {
            $this->subject = $subject;
        }

        public function getBody()
        {
            return $this->body;
        }

        public function setBody($body)
        {
            $this->body = $body;
        }
    }

As you can see this class just defines some protected members and the accessors
for them. There is nothing here that defines how we validate the members, or
how the members relate to form elements. We will
come back to that later.


.. note::

    Lets take a quick aside to talk about the use of namespaces in Symfony2. The entity class
    we have created sets the namespace to ``Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity``. As Symfony2
    autoloading supports the
    `PSR-0 standard <http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/>`_
    the namespace directly maps to the Bundle folder structure. The ``Enquiry`` entity class
    is located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Enquiry.php`` which ensures Symfony2 is able to
    correctly autoload the class.

    How does the Symfony2 autoloader know the ``Blogger`` namespace can be found in the ``src``
    directory? This is thanks to the configurations in the autoloader at ``app/autoloader.php``

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/autoloader.php
        $loader->registerNamespaceFallbacks(array(
            __DIR__.'/../src',
        ));

    This statement registers a fallback for any namespaces not already registered.
    As the ``Blogger`` namespace is not registered, the Symfony2 autoloader will
    look for the required files in the ``src`` directory.

    Autoloading and namespaces are a very powerful concept in Symfony2. If you
    are getting errors where PHP is unable to find classes, its likely you have a
    mistake in your namespace or folder structure. Also check the namespace
    has been registered with the autoloader as shown above. You should not be tempted to
    ``fix`` this by using the PHP ``require`` or ``include`` directives.

Forms
-----

Next we will create the form. Symfony2 comes bundled with a very powerful form
framework that makes the tedious task of dealing with forms easy. As with all
Symfony2 components, it can be used outside of Symfony2 in your own projects.
The `Form Component Source <https://github.com/symfony/Form>`_ is available on
Github. We will begin by creating an ``AbstractType`` class that represents the enquiry form.
We could have created the form directly in the controller and not
bothered with this class, however separating the form into its own class allows
us to reuse the form throughout the application. It also prevents us cluttering up
the controller. After all, the controller is supposed to be simple. It
purpose is to provide the glue between the Model and the View.

EnquiryType
~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new file located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Form/EnquiryType.php`` and
paste in the following content.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Form/EnquiryType.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Form;

    use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;

    class EnquiryType extends AbstractType
    {
        public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
        {
            $builder->add('name');
            $builder->add('email', 'email');
            $builder->add('subject');
            $builder->add('body', 'textarea');
        }

        public function getName()
        {
            return 'blogger_blogbundle_enquirytype';
        }
    }

The ``EnquiryType`` class introduces the ``FormBuilderInterface`` interface. This interface
is used by the ``FormBuilder`` class. The ``FormBuilder`` class is your best friend when
it comes to creating forms. It is able to simplify the process of defining fields based
on the metadata the field has. As our Enquiry entity is so simple we haven't defined any
metadata yet so the ``FormBuilder`` will default the field type to text input. This is
suitable for most of the fields except body where we want a ``textarea``, and email where
we want to take advantage of the new email input type in HTML5.

.. note::

    One key point to mention here is that the ``getName`` method should return
    a unique identifier.

Creating the form in the controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we have defined the ``Enquiry`` entity and ``EnquiryType``, we can update the contact action to
use them. Replace the content of the contact action located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php`` with the following.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php
    public function contactAction(Request $request)
    {
        $enquiry = new Enquiry();
        $form = $this->createForm(new EnquiryType(), $enquiry);

        $form->handleRequest($request);
        
        if ($form->isSubmitted()) {

            if ($form->isValid()) {
                // Perform some action, such as sending an email

                // Redirect - This is important to prevent users re-posting
                // the form if they refresh the page
                return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('BloggerBlogBundle_contact'));
            }
        }

        return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Page:contact.html.twig', array(
            'form' => $form->createView()
        ));
    }

We begin by creating an instance of the ``Enquiry`` entity. This entity represent
the data of a contact enquiry. Next we create the actual form. We specify the
``EnquiryType`` we created earlier, and pass in our enquiry entity object. The
``createForm`` method is able to use these 2 blueprints to create a form representation.

As this controller action will deal with displaying and processing the submitted form, we
need to check the HTTP method. Submitted forms are usually sent via ``POST``, and our
form will be no exception. We call ``handleRequest`` on the ``$form`` object and pass the ``$request`` object.
This will also transform the submitted data back to the members of our ``$enquiry`` object. 
We can now check if the form is submitted using the ``isSubmitted`` method
on the ``$form`` object.
At this point the ``$enquiry`` object now holds a representation of what the user submitted.

Next we make a check to see if the form is valid. As we have specified no validators
at the point, the form will always be valid.

Finally we specify the template to render. Note that we are now also passing
over a view representation of the form to the template. This object allow us to
render the form in the view.

As we have used 2 new classes in our controller we need to import the namespaces.
Update the controller file located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php``
with the following. The statements should be placed under the existing ``use`` statement.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Controller;

    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
    // Import new namespaces
    use Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Enquiry;
    use Blogger\BlogBundle\Form\EnquiryType;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    class PageController extends Controller
    // ..

Rendering the form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to Twig's methods rendering forms is very simple. Twig provides a
layered system for form rendering that allows you to render the form as one entire
entity, or as individual errors and elements, depending on the level of customisation
you require.

To demonstrate the power of Twig's methods we can use the following snippet
to render the entire form.

.. code-block:: html

    <form action="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_contact') }}" method="post" {{ form_enctype(form) }}>
        {{ form_widget(form) }}

        <input type="submit" />
    </form>

While this is very useful for prototyping and simple forms it has its limitations
when extended customisations are needed, which is often the case with forms.

For our contact form, we will opt for the middle ground. Replace the template
code located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/contact.html.twig``
with the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/contact.html.twig #}
    {% extends 'BloggerBlogBundle::layout.html.twig' %}

    {% block title %}Contact{% endblock%}

    {% block body %}
        <header>
            <h1>Contact symblog</h1>
        </header>

        <p>Want to contact symblog?</p>

        <form action="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_contact') }}" method="post" {{ form_enctype(form) }} class="blogger">
            {{ form_errors(form) }}

            {{ form_row(form.name) }}
            {{ form_row(form.email) }}
            {{ form_row(form.subject) }}
            {{ form_row(form.body) }}

            {{ form_rest(form) }}

            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
        </form>
    {% endblock %}

As you can see, we use 4 new Twig methods to render the form.

The first method ``form_enctype`` sets the form content type. This must be set
when your form deals with file uploads. Our form doesn't have any use for this
method but its always good practice to use this on all forms in the event
that you may add file uploads in the future. Debugging a form that handles file
uploads that has no content type set can be a real head scratcher!

The second method ``form_errors`` will render any errors the form has in the event
that validation failed.

The third method ``form_row`` outputs the entire elements related to each form field.
This include any errors for the field, the field label and the actual field
element.

Finally we use the ``form_rest`` method. Its always a safe bet to use the method at the
end of the form to render any fields you may have forgotten, including hidden
fields and the Symfony2 Form CSRF token.

.. note::

    Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is explained in details in the
    `Forms chapter <http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html#csrf-protection>`_
    of the Symfony2 book.


Styling the form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you view the contact form now via ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/contact``
you will notice it doesn't look that appealing. Lets add some styles to improve
this look. As the styles are specific to the form within our Blog bundle
we will create the styles in a new stylesheet within the bundle itself. Create a
new file located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/public/css/blog.css`` and
paste in the following content.

.. code-block:: css

    .blogger-notice { text-align: center; padding: 10px; background: #DFF2BF; border: 1px solid; color: #4F8A10; margin-bottom: 10px; }
    form.blogger { font-size: 16px; }
    form.blogger div { clear: left; margin-bottom: 10px; }
    form.blogger label { float: left; margin-right: 10px; text-align: right; width: 100px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: top; padding-top: 10px; }
    form.blogger input[type="text"],
    form.blogger input[type="email"]
        { width: 500px; line-height: 26px; font-size: 20px; min-height: 26px; }
    form.blogger textarea { width: 500px; height: 150px; line-height: 26px; font-size: 20px; }
    form.blogger input[type="submit"] { margin-left: 110px; width: 508px; line-height: 26px; font-size: 20px; min-height: 26px; }
    form.blogger ul li { color: #ff0000; margin-bottom: 5px; }


We need to let the application know we want to use this stylesheet. We could
import the stylesheet into the contact template but as other templates will
also use this stylesheet later, it makes sense to import it into the
``BloggerBlogBundle`` layout we created in chapter 1. Open up the
``BloggerBlogBundle`` layout located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig`` and replace
with the following content.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig #}
    {% extends '::base.html.twig' %}

    {% block stylesheets %}
        {{ parent() }}
        <link href="{{ asset('bundles/bloggerblog/css/blog.css') }}" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
    {% endblock %}

    {% block sidebar %}
        Sidebar content
    {% endblock %}

You can see we have defined a stylesheet block to override the stylesheet block
defined in the parent template. However, its important to notice the call to the
``parent`` method. This will import the content from the stylesheets block in
the parent template located at ``app/Resources/base.html.twig``, allowing us
to append our new stylesheet. After all, we don't want to replace the existing stylesheets.

In order for the ``asset`` function to correctly link up the the resource we need to
copy over or link the bundle resources into the applications ``web`` folder. This can
be done with the following

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console assets:install web --symlink

.. note::

    If you are using an Operating System that doesn't support symlinks such as
    Windows you will need to drop the symlink option as follows.

    .. code-block:: bash

        php app/console assets:install web

    This method will actually copy the resources from the bundles ``public`` folder into the
    applications ``web`` folder. As the files are actually copied, you will need to run
    this task every time you make a change to a bundles public resource.

Now if you refresh the contact page the form will be beautifully styled.

.. image:: /_static/images/part_2/contact.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: symblog contact form

.. tip::

    While the ``asset`` function provides the functionality we require to use
    resources, there is a better alternative for this. The
    `Assetic <https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic>`_ library by
    `Kris Wallsmith <https://github.com/kriswallsmith>`_ is bundled
    with the Symfony2 standard distribution by default. This library
    provides asset management far beyond the standard Symfony2 capabilities.
    Assetic allows us to run filters on assets to automatically combine,
    minify and gzip them. It can also run compression filters on images. Assetic
    further allows us to reference resources directly within the bundles public
    folder without having to run the ``assets:install`` task. We will explore the
    use of Assetic in later chapters.

Failure to submit
-----------------

The eager ones among you may have already tried to submit the form to be
greeted with a Symfony2 error.

.. image:: /_static/images/part_2/post_error.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: No route found for "POST /contact": Method Not Allowed (Allow: GET, HEAD)

This error is telling us that there is no route to match ``/contact``
for the HTTP method POST. The route only accepts GET and HEAD requests.
This is because we configured our route with the method requirement of
GET.

Lets update the contact route located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml`` to also allow POST requests.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml
    BloggerBlogBundle_contact:
        pattern:  /contact
        defaults: { _controller: BloggerBlogBundle:Page:contact }
        requirements:
            _method:  GET|POST

.. tip::

    You maybe wondering why the route would allow the HEAD method when only
    GET was specified. This is because HEAD is a GET request
    but only the HTTP Headers are returned.

Now when you submit the form it should function as expected, although expected
doesn't actually do much yet. The page will just redirect you back to the contact
form.

Validators
----------

The Symfony2 validator allows us to perform the task of data validation. Validation
is a common task when dealing with data from forms. Validation also needs to be
performed on data before it is submitted to a database. The Symfony2 validator
allows us to separate our validation logic away from the components that may use it,
such as the Form component or the Database component. This approach means we have one
set of validation rules for an object.

Let's begin by updating the ``Enquiry`` entity located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Enquiry.php`` to specify some Validators.
Ensure you add the 5 new ``use`` statements at the top of the file.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Enquiry.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity;

    use Symfony\Component\Validator\Mapping\ClassMetadata;
    use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints\NotBlank;
    use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints\Email;
    use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints\Length;

    class Enquiry
    {
        // ..

        public static function loadValidatorMetadata(ClassMetadata $metadata)
        {
            $metadata->addPropertyConstraint('name', new NotBlank());

            $metadata->addPropertyConstraint('email', new Email());

            $metadata->addPropertyConstraint('subject', new NotBlank());
            $metadata->addPropertyConstraint('subject', new Length(array(
                'max' => 50,
            )));

            $metadata->addPropertyConstraint('body', new Length(array(
                'min' => 50,
            )));
        }

        // ..

    }

To define the validators we must implement the static method
``loadValidatorMetadata``. This provides us with an object of
``ClassMetadata``. We can use this object to set property constraints
on our entity members. The first statement applies the ``NotBlank``
constraint to the ``name`` member. The ``NotBlank`` validator is as simple
as it sounds, it will only return ``true`` if the value it is validating is
not empty. Next we setup validation for the ``email`` member. The Symfony2
Validator service provides a validator for
`emails <http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/Email.html>`_
that will even check MX records to ensure the domain is valid. On the ``subject``
member we want to set a ``NotBlank`` and a ``Length`` constraint.
You can apply as many validators to a member as you wish.

A full list of
`validator constrains <http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints.html>`_
is available in the Symfony2 reference documents. It is also possible to
`create custom validators <http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/validation/custom_constraint.html>`_.

Now when you submit the contact form, your submitted data will be passed through the
validation constraints. Try typing in an invalid email address. You
should see an error message informing you that the email address is invalid. Each
validator provides a default message that can be overridden if required.
To change the message output by the email validator you would do the following.

.. code-block:: php

    $metadata->addPropertyConstraint('email', new Email(array(
        'message' => 'symblog does not like invalid emails. Give me a real one!'
    )));

.. tip::

    If you are using a browser that supports HTML5 (it is likely you are)
    you will be prompted with HTML5 messages enforcing certain constraints.
    This is client side validation and Symfony2 will set suitable HTML5 constraints
    based on your ``Entity`` metadata. You can see this on the email element. The
    output HTML is

    .. code-block:: html

        <input type="email" value="" required="required" name="contact[email]" id="contact_email">

    It has used one of the new HTML5 Input type fields, email and has set the required
    attribute. Client side validation is great in that it doesn't require a round
    trip to the server to validate the form. However, client side validation
    should not be used alone. You should always validate submitted data server
    side as it's quite easy for a user to by-pass the client side validation.

Sending the email
-----------------

While our contact form will allow users to submit enquiries, nothing actually happens
with them yet. Let's update the controller to send an email to the blog webmaster.
Symfony2 comes complete with the `Swift Mailer <http://swiftmailer.org/>`_
library for sending emails. Swift Mailer is a very powerful library,
we will only scratch the surface of what this library can perform.

Configure Swift Mailer settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Swift Mailer is already configured out of the box to work in the Symfony2 Standard
Distribution, however we need to configure some settings regarding sending methods,
and credentials. Open up the parameters file located at ``app/config/parameters.yml`` and
find the settings prefixed with ``mailer_``.

.. code-block:: text

    mailer_transport: smtp
    mailer_host: 127.0.0.1
    mailer_user: null
    mailer_password: null

Swift Mailer provides a number of methods for sending emails, including using an
SMTP server, using a local install of sendmail, or even using a GMail account.
For simplicity we will use a GMail account. Update the parameters with the following,
substituting your username and password where necessary.

.. code-block:: text

    mailer_transport: gmail
    mailer_encryption: ssl
    mailer_auth_mode: login
    mailer_host: smtp.gmail.com
    mailer_user: your_username
    mailer_password: your_password

.. warning::

    Be careful if you are using a Version Control System (VCS) like Git for
    your project, especially if your repository is publicly accessible as your
    GMail username and password will be committed to the repository and will be
    available for anybody to see. You should make sure the file
    ``app/config/parameters.ini`` is added to the ignore list of your VCS. A common
    approach to this problem is to suffix the file name of the file
    that has sensitive information such as ``app/config/parameters.ini`` with ``.dist``.
    You then provide sensible defaults for the settings in this file and add the
    actual file, i.e. ``app/config/parameters.ini`` to you VCS ignore list.
    You can then deploy the ``*.dist`` file with your project and allow the developer to
    remove the ``.dist`` extension and fill in the required settings.

Update the controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the ``Page`` controller located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php``
with the content below.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php

    public function contactAction()
    {
        // ..
        if ($form->isValid()) {

            $message = \Swift_Message::newInstance()
                ->setSubject('Contact enquiry from symblog')
                ->setFrom('enquiries@symblog.co.uk')
                ->setTo('email@email.com')
                ->setBody($this->renderView('BloggerBlogBundle:Page:contactEmail.txt.twig', array('enquiry' => $enquiry)));
            $this->get('mailer')->send($message);

            $this->get('session')->getFlashBag()->add('blogger-notice', 'Your contact enquiry was successfully sent. Thank you!');

            // Redirect - This is important to prevent users re-posting
            // the form if they refresh the page
            return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('BloggerBlogBundle_contact'));
        }
        // ..
    }

When you have used the Swift Mailer library to create a ``Swift_Message`` instance,
that can be sent as an email.

.. note::

    As the Swift Mailer library does not use namespaces, we need to
    prefix the Swift Mailer class with a ``\``. This tells PHP
    to escape back to the
    `global space <http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.global.php>`_.
    You will need to prefix all classes and functions that are not
    namespaced with a ``\``. If you did not place this prefix before the
    ``Swift_Message`` class PHP would look for the class in the
    current namespace, which in this example is
    ``Blogger\BlogBundle\Controller``, causing an error to be thrown.

We have also set a ``flash`` message on the session. Flash messages are messages
that persist for exactly one request. After that they are
automatically cleaned up by Symfony2. The ``flash`` message will be displayed in the
contact template to inform the user the enquiry has been sent. As ``flash`` message
only persist for exactly one request, they are perfect for notifying the user of
the success of the previous actions.

To display the ``flash`` message we need to update the contact template
located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/contact.html.twig``.
Update the content of the template with the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/contact.html.twig #}

    {# rest of template ... #}
    <header>
        <h1>Contact symblog</h1>
    </header>

    {% for flashMessage in app.session.flashbag.get('blogger-notice') %}
        <div class="blogger-notice">
            {{ flashMessage }}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}

    <p>Want to contact symblog?</p>

    {# rest of template ... #}

This checks to see if a ``flash`` message with the identifier
'blogger-notice' is set and outputs it.

Register webmaster email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symfony2 provides a configuration system that we can use to define our own
settings. We will use this system to set the webmaster email address rather
than hard coding the address in the controller above. That way we can easily
reuse this value in other places without code duplication. Further, when your
blog has generated so much traffic the enquiries become too much for you
to deal with, you can easily update the email address to pass the emails
onto your assistant. Create a new file at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/config.yml`` and paste in the
following.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/config.yml
    parameters:
        # Blogger contact email address
        blogger_blog.emails.contact_email: contact@email.com

When defining parameters it is good practice to break the parameter name into a number
of components. The first part should be a lower cased version of the bundle name
using underscores to separate words. In our example we have transformed the
bundle ``BloggerBlogBundle`` into ``blogger_blog``. The remaining part of the
parameter name can contain any number of parts separated by the . (period) character.
This allows us to logically group parameters together.

In order for the Symfony2 application to use the new parameters, we need to import
the config into the main application config file located at ``app/config/config.yml``.
To achieve this, update the ``imports`` directive at the top of the file to the following.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    imports:
        # .. existing import here
        - { resource: @BloggerBlogBundle/Resources/config/config.yml }

The import path is the physical location of the file on disk. The
``@BloggerBlogBundle`` directive will resolve to the path of the
``BloggerBlogBundle`` which is ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle``.

Finally let's update the contact action to use the parameter.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php

    public function contactAction()
    {
        // ..
        if ($form->isValid()) {

            $message = \Swift_Message::newInstance()
                ->setSubject('Contact enquiry from symblog')
                ->setFrom('enquiries@symblog.co.uk')
                ->setTo($this->container->getParameter('blogger_blog.emails.contact_email'))
                ->setBody($this->renderView('BloggerBlogBundle:Page:contactEmail.txt.twig', array('enquiry' => $enquiry)));
            $this->get('mailer')->send($message);

            // ..
        }
        // ..
    }

.. tip::

    As the config file is imported at the top of the application configuration file
    we can easily override any of the imported parameters in the application.
    For example, adding the following to the bottom of ``app/config/config.yml``
    would override the bundle set value for the parameter.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        parameters:
            # Blogger contact email address
            blogger_blog.emails.contact_email: assistant@email.com

    These customisation allow for the bundle to provide sensible defaults for values
    where the application can override them.

.. note::

    While its easy to create bundle configuration parameters using this method
    Symfony2 also provides a method where you
    `expose a Semantic Configuration <http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/bundles/extension.html>`_
    for a bundle. We will explore this method later in the tutorial.

Create the Email template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The body of the email is set to render a template. Create this template at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/contactEmail.txt.twig`` and add
the following.

.. code-block:: text

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/contactEmail.txt.twig #}
    A contact enquiry was made by {{ enquiry.name }} at {{ "now" | date("Y-m-d H:i") }}.

    Reply-To: {{ enquiry.email }}
    Subject: {{ enquiry.subject }}
    Body:
    {{ enquiry.body }}

The content of the email is just the enquiry the user submitted.

You may have also noticed the extension of this template is different to the other
templates we have created. It uses the extension ``.txt.twig``. The first part
of the extension, ``.txt`` specifies the format of the file to generate.
Common formats here include, .txt, .html, .css, .js, .xml and .json. The last part of the
extension specifies which templating engine to use, in this case Twig. An extension
of ``.php`` would use PHP to render the template instead.

When you now submit an enquiry, an email will be sent to the address set in the
``blogger_blog.emails.contact_email`` parameter.

.. tip::

    Symfony2 allows us to configure the behavior of the Swift Mailer library
    while operating in different Symfony2 environments. We can already see this
    in use for the ``test`` environment. By default, the Symfony 2 Standard
    Distribution configures Swift Mailer to not send emails when running in the ``test``
    environment. This is set in the test configuration file located at
    ``app/config/config_test.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config_test.yml
        swiftmailer:
            disable_delivery: true

    It could be useful to duplicate this functionality for the ``dev`` environment.
    After all, you don't want to accidentally send an email to the wrong email address
    while developing. To achieve this, add the above configuration to the
    ``dev`` configuration file located at ``app/config/config_dev.yml``.

    You may be wondering how you can now test that the emails are being sent, and
    more specifically the content of them, seeing as they will no longer be delivered
    to an actual email address. Symfony2 has a solution for this via the developer
    toolbar. When an email is sent an email notification icon will appear in the toolbar
    that has all the information about the email that Swift Mailer would have delivered.

    .. image:: /_static/images/part_2/email_notifications.jpg
        :align: center
        :alt: Symfony2 toolbar show email notifications

    If you perform a redirect after sending an email, like we do for the contact form,
    you will need to set the ``intercept_redirects`` setting in ``app/config/config_dev.yml``
    to true in order to see the email notification in the toolbar.

    We could have instead configured Swift Mailer to send all emails to a specific
    email address in the ``dev`` environment by placing the following
    setting in the ``dev`` configuration file located at ``app/config/config_dev.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config_dev.yml
        swiftmailer:
            delivery_address:  development@symblog.dev

Conclusion
----------

We have demonstrated the concepts behind creating one of the most fundamental part of any
website: forms. Symfony2 comes complete with an excellent Validator and Form library
that allows us to separate validation logic out of the form so it can be used
by other parts of the application (such as the Model). We were also introduced to
setting custom configuration settings that can be read into our application.

Next we will look at a big part of this tutorial, The Model. We will introduce
Doctrine 2 and use it to define the blog Model. We will also build the show blog
page and explore the concept of Data fixtures .
